      <h2>Now I'm actually going to talk about something relevant</h2>
      <h3>'Why I need Feminism'</h3>
      <div1>
        <p>
          Okay so I read books on wattpad (such a nerd I know), but I came across this chapter in a miscellenious book and it really stood out to me because I literally related to almost all of them. Also <strong>trigger warning</strong>.
        </p>
        <a href="https://my.w.tt/u8dtc7ZMlY"> This is where you can read it.</a>
        <p>
          Basically the girl is talking about the different expectations and stereotypes society has for females.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the points she made about why she needed feminism were:
        </p>
        <div2>
          <p>
            "Because I enjoy feminine things like makeup, nice clothes, and shoes and am tired of feeling less than the girls who prefer to be natural"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Because I understand that men have issues too"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Because our beautiful trans sisters are being murdered (especially black trans women) and it does not gain enough media coverage"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Becuase I cannot walk in the city alone at night without the discomfort of cat calling"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Because I have been trained to judge and tear down other women who are not like myslef and it has take yearas of work to even begin to put a stop to it"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Because the idea that men mature slower is a myth that is merely the product of men not being given responsibility as early as women are."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Because I am not particularly maternal and am tired of feeling less like a women for it"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Because we as a society need to start acknowledging the nuances of treatment people receive whether that is for being a women & LGBT, disabled, WOC, poor, an immigrant, or any other intersection of identities that may lead to unfairness"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Because I sometimes get perceived as bossy or b****y just for being assertive and bossy"
          </p>
        </div2>
        <p>
          honestly, I could go on and list all her reasons, but I don't want to take up all of your time. In conclusion, society is messed up and full of stereotypes and expectations. Its very toxic and often leads to a not so positive train of thought.
          So I urge you to break the norms or fit into the norms OR just do what YOU want.
          In the end, you will always be there for you, people come and go. Don't ever feel the need to do something for the pleasure of others unless that is what you truly want. People come and go.
          (im sorry that totally sounded like the conclusion to an essay, but i hope you get my point)
